title: DAP Building Blocks
---

Decentralized Agnostic Paytags (DAPs) are a new approach to sending and receiving payments across
different apps and currencies. To understand how DAPs work, it's essential to grasp the key
components that make up the DAP ecosystem. In this section, we'll explore the building blocks of
DAPs and how they interact to simplify cross-platform payments.

## Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

At the heart of the DAP ecosystem are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). A DID is a unique,
cryptographically-verifiable identifier that represents an individual, organization, or entity. DIDs
are designed to be self-sovereign, meaning that the owner has full control over their identifier and
can prove ownership without relying on a central authority.

In the context of DAPs, DIDs serve as the foundation for associating payment addresses with a
human-readable handle. When a user registers a DAP, they're essentially creating a mapping between
their DID and a chosen handle.

## DAP Handles

A DAP handle is a human-friendly, email-like identifier that can be shared with others to send and
receive payments. It consists of two parts: a local handle and a domain.
For example: `@alice/example.com`.

The local handle is unique within the context of the domain. It's up to the domain owner to define
the format and requirements for local handles, but typically they follow a set of common conventions
to ensure readability and compatibility.

## DAP Registries

DAP registries are the services responsible for managing the mapping between DAP handles and DIDs.
Each domain that supports DAPs must provide its own registry, which exposes a standardized API for
registering and resolving DAP handles.

When a user registers a DAP handle, the registry associates the handle with the user's DID and
stores this mapping. When someone wants to send a payment to a DAP, they query the registry to
resolve the handle to its corresponding DID.

## Money Addresses

Money addresses are the final piece of the DAP puzzle. They represent the actual destination for a
payment, whether it's a cryptocurrency wallet, a bank account, or any other type of financial
account.

In the DAP ecosystem, money addresses are expressed as Uniform Resource Names (URNs) with a
standardized format: `urn:<currency_code>:<address>`. For example, a Bitcoin address might be
represented as `urn:btc:1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2`.

When a user registers a DAP, they can associate one or more money addresses with their DID. This
allows them to receive payments in multiple currencies or at multiple destinations.

## Putting it All Together

Now that we've covered the key building blocks, let's walk through a typical DAP payment flow to see
how they all fit together:

1. Alice registers a DAP handle (`@alice/example.com`) with her DID (`did:example:123`) at the
   `example.com` DAP registry.
2. Alice associates a Bitcoin address (`urn:btc:1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2`) with her DID.
3. Bob wants to send Alice a payment, so he queries the `example.com` registry to resolve
   `@alice/example.com` to Alice's DID.
4. Bob retrieves Alice's Bitcoin address from her DID document and sends the payment to
   `urn:btc:1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2`.

By abstracting away the complexity of different payment networks and currencies, DAPs provide a
simple, unified interface for sending and receiving payments. The decentralized nature of DIDs and
the standardized APIs for DAP registries ensure that the ecosystem remains open, interoperable, and
resilient.
