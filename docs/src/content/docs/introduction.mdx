Welcome to DAPs - Decentralized Agnostic Paytags

What are DAPs?

DAPs, or Decentralized Agnostic Paytags, are a new way to send and receive money across different
apps, currencies, and payment networks. Just like email made communication simple and universal,
DAPs aim to do the same for digital payments.

With DAPs, you can send money to anyone using a simple, human-friendly handle called a paytag, which
looks like an email address (e.g., `@alice/example.com`). No more complicated wallet addresses or
siloed payment apps DAPs unify payment networks and simplify transactions for everyone.

How DAPs Work

At the core of DAPs are three key components:

1. Paytags: Paytags are email-like handles that uniquely identify a user's payment information. They consist of a username and a domain (e.g., `@bob/example.com`).
1. Money Addresses: Money addresses are standardized URIs that represent a user's various payment accounts across different currencies and networks (e.g., BTC, ETH, USDC). Each money address is linked to a user's paytag.
1. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): DIDs are decentralized, cryptographically-verifiable identifiers that associate a user's paytags with their money addresses. DIDs enable secure and private payment information lookup without relying on a central authority.

When someone wants to send money using DAPs, they simply enter the recipient's paytag in their preferred payment app. The app then resolves the paytag to the recipient's DID, retrieves their money addresses, and prompts the sender to choose the currency and network they want to use. The payment is then securely sent to the recipient's corresponding money address.
