# This CODEOWNERS file denotes the project leads
# and encodes their responsibilities for code review.

# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# The format is described: https://github.blog/2017-07-06-introducing-code-owners/

# These owners will be the default owners for all directories in the repo that do not have a
# designated owner.
*       @mistermoe @frankhinek


# -----------------------------------------------
# BELOW THIS LINE ARE TEMPLATES, UNUSED
# -----------------------------------------------
# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches javascript files, only these owners
# will be requested to review.
# *.js    @octocat @github/js

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer.
